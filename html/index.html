            <div>
                Step into any ROCKEY BURGERS, and you’ll notice we’re different.
                From our famous (free) house-made pickles, to the hand-painted
                signage, to our cheerful staff, we build our restaurants like we build
                our burgers–sustainably, locally, and with an unwavering commitment
                to quality.
            </div>
            <div>
                Fresh, quality produce, meat, dairy and buns, sourced from partners
                located just miles from our restaurants, are the ingredients to making
                the perfect burger. This commitment to creating the best possible food
                for our guests is a direct reflection of our promise of creating fast food
                burgers using slow food values.
            </div>

                Bite into any Super burger, and taste the difference.
                Our burgers, fries, and shakes are made with the finest,
                freshest ingredients available.
            </div>
            <div>
                All our beef is Rockey Farms, humanely-raised, vegetarian-fed,
                ground fresh daily, and sourced from a family-owned ranch.
            </div>
            <div>
                All of our shakes and cones are made with organic cream from
                Rockey Creamery, a small, family-owned, organic farm located South
                of Nephi, Utah.
            </div>
            <div>
                Our buns are baked to our specification by an artisan baker in Nephi,
                UT
            </div>
            <div>
                The potatoes we use to make our French fries are made from
                potatoes grown in North America by growers who are required to
                identify the genetic source of their seed potatoes. We do not work with
                genetically modified potato varieties. Our potatoes are processed
                fresh off the field and delivered to us without any modifications. We
                proudly serve Sir Kensington ketchup.

            <div id='first-par' style='display:none'>
                We focus on making meals with the best and freshest ingredients, like
                humanely-raised beef that is ground fresh each day, organic chicken,
                and Rockey Family Dairy’s organic cream for our ice cream cones,
                sundaes and shakes.
                Our commitment to freshness and quality means higher prices than
                you’d find at traditional fast-food burger chains. It also means food
                that tastes way better — because, well, it is.
            </div>
            <div onclick='secPar()'>Where does your beef come from? (click)</div>
            <div id='second-par' style='display:none'>
                We source our humanely-raised, vegetarian-fed beef from local,
                family-owned ranches. We use an 85% to 15% protein to fat blend, a
                mixture of the lean protein and the marbling found on in a cut of steak
                for our ground beef. The mixture is ground daily, and thus, our
                burgers taste so amazing.
